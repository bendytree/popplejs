		<h1>Fry and the Slurm Factory</h1>
		<p>Hey, whatcha watching? I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that. Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages! Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. Why would a robot need to drink?</p>
		<h2>I Dated a Robot</h2>
		<p>Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT! Daylight and everything. Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat. You're going to do his laundry?</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Who am I making this out to?</li>
		<li>Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages!</li>
		<li>I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>The 30% Iron Chef</h3>
		<p>Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig". Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew. Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral! Yeah, I do that with my stupidness.</p>
		<h4>The Luck of the Fryrish</h4>
		<p>Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man. You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus? Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very&hellip;</p>
		<ol>
		<li>You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing.</li>
		<li>It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too.</li>
		</ol>
		<h5>A Taste of Freedom</h5>
		<p>Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay! Goodbye, friends.  I never thought I'd die like this.  But I always really hoped. Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry? Look, last night was a mistake.</p>
		<h6>A Pharaoh to Remember</h6>
		<p>Soothe us with sweet lies. And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet. It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. Who are you, my warranty?!</p>
		<p>You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing. Fatal. It doesn't look so shiny to me. Say it in Russian!</p>
		<p>It's a T. It goes "tuh". Oh yeah, good luck with that. No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography. Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker. Okay, I like a challenge.</p>
		<p>Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy. I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died. Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you. Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be&hellip; Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most.</p>
		<p>Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all. Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools.</p>
		<p>Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. Hello Morbo, how's the family? Look, last night was a mistake.</p>
		<p>Is the Space Pope reptilian!? Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually! Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you! Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty?</p>
		<p>Large bet on myself in round one. But existing is basically all I do! You are the last hope of the universe. Shinier than yours, meatbag. I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him.</p>
		<p>Who am I making this out to? It's toe-tappingly tragic! And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet.</p>
		<p>Bender?! You stole the atom. Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? Please, Don-Bot&hellip; look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file!</p>
		<p>Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. Why did you bring us here? Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty? Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty? Why would a robot need to drink?</p>
		<p>Ooh, name it after me! Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood! You lived before you met me?! You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing.</p>
		<p>Who are you, my warranty?! Ummm&hellip;to eBay? You've killed me! Oh, you've killed me!</p>
		<p>Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it&hellip; then perhaps gifts! Well, then good news! It's a suppository. That's not soon enough! Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets?</p>
		<p>Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! Really?! What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso! Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? &hellip;To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? &hellip;To shreds, you say.</p>
